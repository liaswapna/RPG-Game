### Instructions
---

* When the game starts, the player will choose a character by clicking on the fighter's picture. The player will fight as that character for the rest of the game.

* The player must then defeat all of the remaining fighters. Enemies should be moved to a different area of the screen.

* The player chooses an opponent by clicking on an enemy's picture.

* Once the player selects an opponent, that enemy is moved to a `defender area`.

* The player will now be able to click the `attack` button.
* Whenever the player clicks `attack`, their character damages the defender. The opponent will lose `HP` (health points). These points are displayed at the bottom of the defender's picture.

* The opponent character will instantly counter the attack. When that happens, the player's character will lose some of their `HP`. These points are shown at the bottom of the player character's picture.

* **NOTE: [Watch the demo](https://youtu.be/klN2-ITjRt8).**
